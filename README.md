## Intro to the course

>I’m sure I’m not the only one who’s accidentally spent hours on YouTube when I had more important things to do! Just how do they convince you to do that? That’s right. `Recommender systems!`


>Facebook: So powerful that world governments are worried that the newsfeed has `too much influence on people!` (Or maybe they are worried about losing their own power... hmm...)


OK, OK. 

The purpose I learn Recommender System is that I want to build a book recommendation system  keeping myself happy.
